Quickstart
==========

* **freqdemod-quickstart-1** [:download:`open html <../freqdemod/docs/freqdemod-quickstart-1.html>`].  Here we apply ``freqdemod`` to a noiseless sine-wave oscillation, obtaining phase *vs* time data from oscillation amplitude *vs* time data. We fit the phase *vs* time data to a line and obtain a slope that with the known frequency of the sine wave to six decimal places.

* **freqdemod-quickstart-2** [:download:`open html <../freqdemod/docs/freqdemod-quickstart-2.html>`].  We generate a frequency-modulated sine-wave signal and use ``freqdemod`` to recover the signal's frequency vs time.
