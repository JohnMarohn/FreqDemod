Quickstart
==========

* **freqdemod-quickstart-1** [:download:`open html <../freqdemod/docs/freqdemod-quickstart-1.html>`].  Here we apply ``freqdemod`` to a noiseless sine-wave oscillation, obtaining phase *vs* time data from oscillation amplitude *vs* time data. We fit the phase *vs* time data to a line and obtain a slope that with the known frequency of the sine wave to six decimal places.
